00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:34.550
By the rain-soaked windowsill

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:47.220
I hum a nostalgic tune

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:59.220
In the emptiness of my young self's heart

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:11.810
A newborn warmth blossoms within

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:26.820
Hand in hand, returning home from
the seaside dyed red of the sunset

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.440
What was nothing more than the usual carefree times,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.340
Had now become very dear moments

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:50.780
On the corners of that old photo album,
remain traces of teardrops

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.350
To the one who found them,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:06.780
I convey to you, "Thank you, and farewell."

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:37.910
As I write this letter,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:50.480
I dream of the good old days

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:02.380
Sleeping at the ocean's floor, remaining unnamed

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:14.080
A single bud, that will sprout into a pure heart

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.780
Hand in hand, we sleep together in the night

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.710
Underneath the shining starry sky

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.310
That warmth you provided for me,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.380
The feeling lingers in my hands

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.810
In these distant, fading memories,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.710
A gentle voice resonates

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:02.010
Telling me to pass on to you,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.080
"Thank you, and farewell."

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:50.750
Hand in hand, returning home from
the seaside dyed red of the sunset

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.380
What was nothing more than an ordinary moment,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.450
Now had become a very dear moment

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:14.710
On the corners of that old photo album,
remains traces of teardrops

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.350
To the one who found this,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:33.310
Thank you, my favorite person

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:48.350
Those dear moments, they'll never come back
